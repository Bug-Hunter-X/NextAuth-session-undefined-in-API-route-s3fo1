# NextAuth session undefined in API route

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using NextAuth.js with API routes.  The problem occurs when the `unstable_getServerSession` function returns `undefined` even after a successful user login.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and authentication failures within API routes.

**Problem:**

The provided code snippet shows an API route that attempts to access the NextAuth session using `unstable_getServerSession`. Despite successful login, the session variable is often `undefined`, resulting in authentication issues.

**Solution:**

The solution addresses this by checking the session object, handling the case where it is undefined, and ensuring correct usage of the `unstable_getServerSession` function.

The core issue lies in how the session is handled and accessed.  The solution provides a robust method of checking and handling the potential `undefined` value.
